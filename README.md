pre-commit install
```

Run containers:

docker compose up -d
docker compose ps  # everything has to be up and running
```

Connect to database using `docker compose exec db psql -U postgres`. Following commands might raise an exception that something is already exists â€“ it's ok:

CREATE ROLE greenlight WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext;
```

```

[ ] add init sql (role creation etc) to docker compose\
[ ] move golang with air to docker\
[ ] apply migration inside docker
